# Clash of Vocabulary Intellects & Dummies (C.O.V.I.D)

This is a game created for the PSP0101 Problem Solving and Program Design assignment for Trimester 1, 2020/2021. The game is a simple English quote puzzle game that can be played by 3 players. The objective of the game is to guess the hidden quote by guessing letters or buying vowels. The game does not have a time limit and will only end when a player correctly solves the puzzle.

## Installation

To install and run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `game.exe` or the `game.py` file using Python 3.

## Usage

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. The game will randomly select a quote from the `quotes.txt` file.
2. The first player will guess a letter or buy a vowel.
3. If the letter is in the quote, it will be revealed. If not, the second player will have a turn.
4. The game will continue until one of the players correctly solves the puzzle.
